This is the code file for the thesis. Please run 1, 2 first to create the relevant files. Then run the 3 files starting with RQ1 to tune models for RQ1. Then the results for RQ2 (disparate results analysis) are in the file results_analysis. Finally, use RQ3 to see RQ3's results. Note, neural network's stochastic nature, despite the seeds, cannot guarantee results that are identifical; the error margin exists by less than 1%. The whole script would take about 7 hours - LSTM tuning takes very long time. GPU acceleration would be of help.
